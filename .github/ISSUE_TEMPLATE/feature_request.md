<!--
Please read this carefully, not reading and/or following this template carefully might result in your issue getting closed without a proper answer.
This template is however a guideline, if you have important or valuable information please add it!
If it is clear that a certain step is completely useless in your situation, feel free to leave it out.

Please note that there is only 1 main contributor to this project.
I might respond quickly, I might not.
I will try to help you to the best of my ability but my abilities are not endless.
I am human and to err is human, I make mistakes, if you think I closed your issue unfairly please considerately explain why you believe my judgement was wrong. I will probably reconsider.

I am not able to solve all your problems and entertain all your feature requests, part of this is because I don't actually own a lot of tuya devices.
A lot of the work I do is based on documentations and how some devices are supposed to work.
Who could have guessed, not all devices behave as they should.

I might say no to your feature request.
Some smarter people with more experience in opensource software put it nicely
"Rule #1 of open-source: saying no is temporary, yes is forever."
If I now start working on implementing your request I will need to support it for as long as I maintain this plugin.
I might not be ready for that kind of commitment for some feature requests.
